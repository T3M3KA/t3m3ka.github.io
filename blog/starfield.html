				Starfield isn't a one-off unintentionally mediocre release from Bethesda. Every Bethesda game since Fallout 3 has been progressively worse. Instead, this is an exercise in just how much Bethesda can get away with before the fans start to clap back. Even at its best, Starfield is no better than a decent AA game from a AAA studio marred by poor and sometimes outright lazy game design choices.

			<p>
				And before someone says it again, no, the game doesn't get better after 20, 50, 100 or 200 hours.

				Starfield has some of the most barren worlds ever in a modern open world game. I'm not talking about the 990 barren planets that are "supposed to be" barren. I'm talking about the planets with "large" human settlements like Jemison and Akila.
			</p>
			<div class="image">

				<span class="caption">Akila City - The Capital and like 80% of the Freestar Collective</span>
			</div>
			<p>
				The cities on these capital planets are small and visually bland with little to do or explore. In fact, all the settlements have the same mix of shops - a gun dealer, a general store, a trading authority outpost, and so on - just with a different coat of paint which takes away the uniqueness and charm of cities having specialized shops or landmarks.<p>Also based on their size and population, either only 3000 humans were able to escape Earth or the subsequent colony wars destroyed like 99.99% of human civilization, which seems unlikely judging by the lack of debris on or around the 1000 planets. This disconnect between whatever little lore Starfield has and the environmental storytelling, compounded by the endless loadscreens only aide in breaking immersion in a genre that thrives on it.</p>
			</p>
			<div class="subheader">War Never Changes</div>
			<p>
				Starfield's combat is separated into two parts - gun combat with space-fus-ro-dah and ship combat. The gun combat is half decent but quickly turns boring and repetitive. Human enemies have braindead AI and will either stand and shoot in the open or charge at you with melee. Alien creatures also appear to have the moveset of a mudcrab from Skyrim. Even a AA game trashed for its combat like Technomancer shines in comparison. The ship combat however is pretty decent when you are the shooting stuff and even lets you blow up engines, board the enemy ship, and have a scuffle. As with gun combat, the enemy ship AI is slow, basic and just targets the middle of your ship which means donut ship builds are and will stay the meta.

				One area where Bethesda has made a significant improvment are the character animations and physics which are pretty good for an RPG, when considering key characters that is. Look any further and the simulation falls apart. Creature animations don't appear to have evolved since Skyrim and NPCs will walk like zombies with their eyes fixated on the nearest point of interest, which is usually you, leading to constant bombastic side eyes.

				Another area of improvement, although minor, is in graphics. This is still a 2021 game that just so happened to launch in 2023 (thanks to Microsoft) but still manages to look like a AA game from 2015. Compared to Fallout 76 (Bethesda's previous trashfest), the key updates appear to be improved lighting, geometry, and support for higher resolution textures. Had Starfield been a decent game, these would have helped the community with making expansive, better looking mods.

				Shipbuilding surprisingly, is the strongest aspect of Starfield and one of the areas I've spent the most time in. Even when this game launched, online forums were more about showing off ship builds than about discussions on story or exploration. Having said all that, this isn't all that great. Having mutliple ship manufacturers makes no sense when all they build is the same rectanglular box with slightly different proportions and re-painted interiors. In fact, the only uniqueness is in the cowling which apart from the DEIMOS and STRAUSS variants aren't scalable. While shipbuilding can be fun and give a real sense of progression, it is wasted when you realize that all a ship is good for is as a fast-travel portal.

			<div class="header">Status Report</div>
			<p>
				It's true that Bethesda RPGs are never really known for their story, but at least till Skyrim the main story and quests were serviceable. Even in Fallout 4, however dumbed down, the storylines at least managed to be consistent. With Starfield, Bethesda have outclassed themselves. Not only is the writing now straight up dogshit, but the questlines at times can't even manage to be consistent or react to in-game changes.<br>Let me show this to you using one of the most broken quests in the game:
			</p>
			<div class="subheader">A Ship Out Of Time</div>
			<p>
				One of the missions you'll come across is called "First Contact" where one fine day, a mysterious ship appears over the skies of Paradiso. As the quest progresses, you are eventually faced with 3 choices - blow up the ship, pay for their grav drive and send them elsewhere, or send them to a life of indentured servitude.
			</p>
			<p>
				Woah dude! Emil's deep thought-provoking masterpiece? No, because this quest makes no sense. In fact, this questline has so many holes I almost wonder if this wasn't intended for a different game.
				<ul>
					<li>How does a pre-grav drive ship just appear over a planet out of nowhere?<br>Surely someone must have seen it slowly travelling through the system.</li>
					<li>Why does nobody remember that it's a human ship?<br>It was the first ship to depart Earth, looks like any large human ship, and even has a compatible hatch.</li>
					<li>The ship launched in 2140 with a group of elites and scientists and was the most advanced for it's time.<br>Surely one scientist must have heard of the Grav Drive especially since ships fitted with Grav Drives started departing 10 years later. Why couldn't they wait?</li>
					<li>Once the Grav Drive was developed, why did no one contact the ship full of elites and let them know?</li>
					<li>The ship computer terminals have the same design and OS as the ones used 200 years later.<br>Not even Windows XP was capable of such feats.<br><i>(Even the quest rewards you with one of the only guns that's fully compatible with ammunition made 200 years later.)</i></li>
					<li>A generational ship is supposed to be colossal and house thousands of people packed alongside habs for food production, recreation etc. In short, they would more closely resemble the Citadel from Mass Effect.<br>Mass Effect never breaks your immersion as it always presents massive areas 1 to 1, even though you can only explore a small part of it. Bethesda, 15 years later, did not even bother to create a massive ship.
					</li>
					<li>As for the choices, the game does not allow you to explore other options like killing the Paradiso board or negotiate for settling the passengers on the other side of the empty planet. In a genre that celebrates player choice and freedom, Bethesda has ordained that the player can no longer be given any freedom.</li>
				</ul>
				To put it bluntly, the main story is one of the worst ever in any game. There's no suspense, no mystery, and no real ending - just a series of fetch quests followed by one combat arena (which you can skip with a "Persuasion" speech) and voila, new game plus. The side quests are better in comparison but even the best side quest here is comparable to an average quest in Skyrim, which isn't really something to cheer about.

				There really is none. Bethesda is renowned for never fixing their bugs and based off the leaked future roadmap from the Microsoft Activision hearings, Starfield will have just one expansion in Mar 2024.<br>Buy something else then instead.
