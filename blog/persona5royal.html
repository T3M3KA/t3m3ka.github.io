				Persona games are challenging to review not because they require you to be a sophisticated, cultured man with a refined palette and a keen eye, but because their fanbase is so fiercely loyal and combative that if you even criticise an aspect of their game, they will start breathing real heavy, ready to kill you in a turn-based weaboo swordfight or since this is online, silence you with downvotes, a barrage of toxic posts, or forum bans. Go to any Persona forum and you will still find Persona 3, 4 and 5 fans fighting for the crown.

				Press PLAY, and Persona 5 reveals itself as a stretched out high-school isekai anime masquerading as a game because it has a couple of button presses for dialogue and a good turn-based combat system - one of the worst combat systems known to mankind. Many JRPG stans will disagree of course but for an RPG, Turn Based Combat is to Combat what Grand Strategy is to Strategy, which is to say it's not combat. Rather, it is a game of basic math and RNG wrapped within a generous Skill/Persona reward system that provides a false sense of progress and accomplishment as the game continues. And since every encounter in this 100+ hour long game plays out the same, you would wish whatever gameplay time that you had left was a cutscene instead.

				If you wanted an anime which is like 80% of what I did here, you would be better off watching an actual anime. There are plenty of options out there that are more rewarding of your time than trying to piece this one together. And if you were looking for a good JRPG (the G stands for "Game", imagine that!), you could just buy any of these instead:
				<ul>
					<li>Yakuza</li>
					<li>Dragon Quest</li>
					<li>NieR</li>
					<li>Final Fantasy</li>
					<li>Octopath Traveller</li>
				</ul>
				Anime or game, there are better options available in the market for this to not make much sense.

				Persona 5 Royal, or the 30 odd hours I have played it for, is not bad. Although not much of a RPG, it's a decent high-school dating anime but certainly doesn't justify the otherworldly hype you would find from stans online. If this was a western studio and not Atlus, they would've released it as a visual novel instead.
